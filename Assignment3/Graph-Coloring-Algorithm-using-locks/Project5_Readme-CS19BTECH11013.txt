  README FILE FOR C++ PROGRAMs FOR 'IMPLEMENTING GRAPH COLORING ALGORITHM USING LOCKS':
  
  1)Firstly,we need to open terminal and go to the corresponding directory where our c++ programs is present using the command "cd directoryname" (Here directoryname is name of the directory in which program are there)
  
  2)Then,Open the c++ program in the text editor, which will open when you type "gedit filename.cxx".(Here filename is name of file)
   (Here, SrcAssgn5_coarse_cs19btech11013.cxx,SrcAssgn5_fine_cs19btech11013.cxx are required files)
   
  3)Save the programs by pressing "ctrl+s".
   
  4)Now open the terminal and type the command "g++ SrcAssgn5_coarse_cs19btech11013.cxx -o exe -lpthread -lrt" and press "enter" to compile the program.
     Here exe is corresponding executable file for the coarse grained program.
    
  5)Then type command "./exe" and press "enter" to run and execute our coarse grained program.
  
  6)Now open the terminal and type the command "g++ SrcAssgn5_fine_cs19btech11013.cxx -o exe2 -lpthread -lrt" and press "enter" to compile the program.
     Here exe2 is corresponding executable file for the fine grained program.
    
  7)Then type command "./exe2" and press "enter" to run and execute our fine grained program.
